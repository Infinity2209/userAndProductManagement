## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend-assignment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the mock API server**
   ```bash
   npm run json-server
   ```
   This starts JSON Server on `http://localhost:3001`

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Development
1. Start the JSON server:
```bash
npm run json-server
```

2. In another terminal, start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

#### Deploying to Netlify with JSON Server Backend

**Prerequisites:**
- A JSON server hosted online (Heroku, Railway, Render, etc.)
- Netlify account

**Steps:**

1. **Host your JSON server:**
   - Upload your `db.json` file to a hosting service
   - Example: Deploy to Heroku with JSON Server
   - Get the URL (e.g., `https://your-json-server.herokuapp.com`)

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variable
   export JSON_SERVER_URL=https://your-json-server.herokuapp.com

   # Run deployment script
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   # Update netlify.toml with your JSON server URL
   # Replace 'https://your-json-server-endpoint.herokuapp.com' with your actual URL

   # Build and deploy
   npm run build
   npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use the deploy script**
   - Set your JSON server URL as an environment variable
   - Run `./deploy.sh` which will automatically update the configuration

**Important Notes:**
- The app automatically detects production environment and uses relative URLs for API calls
- Netlify redirects handle routing API calls to your JSON server
- Make sure your JSON server allows CORS from your Netlify domain

#### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

**404 Errors on API calls (like "products:1 Failed to load resource"):**
- Verify your JSON server is running and accessible at the specified URL
- Check that the URL in `netlify.toml` matches your JSON server exactly
- Ensure your JSON server supports the exact endpoints (`/users`, `/products`)
- Test your JSON server directly by visiting the URL in a browser

**Connection Refused:**
- Make sure you're using HTTPS URLs in production (required by Netlify)
- Verify the JSON server endpoint is correct and publicly accessible
- Check if your JSON server requires authentication or has CORS restrictions

**CORS Issues:**
- Configure your JSON server to allow requests from your Netlify domain
- Add CORS headers to your JSON server configuration
- Example for JSON Server: add `"--host 0.0.0.0 --cors"` to your start command

**Redirect Not Working:**
- Ensure `netlify.toml` is in the root directory
- Check that the redirect patterns match your API calls exactly
- Verify the JSON server URL doesn't have trailing slashes

## 🔐 Authentication

### Default Credentials
- **Admin User**: Any user with `role: "admin"` in `db.json`
- **Regular User**: Any user with `role: "user"` in `db.json`

### Login Process
1. Enter email and password
2. JWT token is stored in localStorage
3. User data and authentication state are managed by Redux

## 📊 API Endpoints

The application uses JSON Server for mock API endpoints:

### Users
- `GET /users` - Get all users
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `POST /users` - Create new user
- `PUT /users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user

### Products
- `GET /products` - Get all products
- `GET /products/:id` - Get product by ID
- `POST /products` - Create new product
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update product
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete product

## 🎨 Customization

### Themes
The app supports light and dark themes. Theme preference is stored in localStorage and respects system preferences.

### Languages
Currently supports English and Spanish. Language files are located in `src/i18n/`.

### Styling
- Colors and spacing can be customized in `tailwind.config.js`
- Component styles use Tailwind utility classes
- Custom CSS variables are defined in `src/index.css`

## 🧪 Development

### Code Quality
- ESLint configuration ensures code consistency
- Prettier formatting for clean code
- TypeScript-ready structure for future migration

### Performance
- Code splitting with Vite
- Lazy loading for route components
- Optimized bundle size with tree shaking
